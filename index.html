  <h4>Bio</h4>
  <p>
  I'm a master student in the <a href="https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/">Nanyang Tech S-Lab/NLP Lab</a> advised by Aixin Sun. I'm interested in developing machine learning tools for information retrieval and natural language generation. My current research is focused on multi-modal information retrieval for video grounding. 
  <p>
  I received my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from UESTC.
